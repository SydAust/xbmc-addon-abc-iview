ABC iView plugin for XBMC
================================

This plugin provides a simple list of available programs from the ABC iView 
web site, and allows you to stream them with.

The content is only available with Australia, or you can apparently use sites
like Unblock-US or your own VPN solution which terminates in with an AU IP 
address.

Installation
------------
This plugin is available as part of the XBMC CatchUp TV AU repository, but
you'll always find the latest version here.

Download the latest ZIP file from the downloads section, and put it into your
'addons' directory of XBMC. This will differ between platforms.

For Windows:
```
	%APPDATA%\XBMC\addons
```

For Linux:
```
	~/.xbmc/addons
```

For Mac:
```
	~/Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons
```

For AppleTV:
```
	/Users/frontrow/Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons
```
